# Source code.

The source code for aaravmain.org is not here. I have moved to gitlab, because why not. (I don't like microsoft)

gitlab.com/aaravmainWebsite/Production. 

also i might post some stuff on https://gitlab.archlinux.org/aarav/ because why not. will make a new repo for everything there

posting here whenever i can. i used to post here more but cant beause I usually dont have a phone on me.
